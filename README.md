Drishti AI: The Agency-First Behavioral Engine
Drishti AI is a high-agency intervention platform designed to bridge the "Digital Intelligence Divide" for engineering students. It terminates the Certification Trap by reclaiming a student's most valuable asset—time—and converting it into verified industrial competence through a non-negotiable, proof-of-work ecosystem.

🚀 The Core Philosophy: Learn. Build. Become.
Standard EdTech focuses on passive consumption. Drishti AI focuses on Behavioral Engineering:

LEARN: Bypassing SEO-garbage to extract foundational logic from industrial engineering blogs (Netflix, Uber, Zomato).

BUILD: Moving from "Proof of Attendance" to Proof of Competence using automated GitHub telemetry.

BECOME: Visualizing the 2030 Career Twin to show the real-time opportunity cost of every wasted hour.

🛠️ Technical Architecture (AWS Native)
This system is built on an enterprise-grade, serverless AWS stack designed for high integrity and real-time scale.

The Intelligence Stack (The Brain)
Amazon Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet): Orchestrates roadmap generation and the "Strict Mentor" reasoning engine.

Amazon OpenSearch (Serverless): Vector database for RAG, storing high-signal "Hidden Gem" industrial resources.

Amazon Textract: Audits course syllabi to detect "Hype vs. Logic Density."

Amazon Translate: Post-processes the Vernacular Bridge to explain logic in regional languages without compromising technical syntax.

The Accountability Stack (The Conscience)
Amazon QLDB: An immutable, cryptographically verifiable ledger for every "Stake" and "Proof of Work" milestone.

Amazon Neptune: A Graph Database mapping non-linear skill pivots (e.g., how Python logic transfers from Data to Dev).

Amazon ElastiCache (Redis): Handles sub-millisecond ranking for the National Agency Leaderboard (AQI).

GitHub API & AWS Lambda: Automated code telemetry to verify actual skill application.

The Predictive Stack (The Future)
Amazon SageMaker: Runs regression models to project 5-year career trajectories based on current "Agency Velocity."

Amazon EventBridge: The system "Heartbeat" that triggers the Morning Slap (9 AM challenge) and Nightly Audit.
